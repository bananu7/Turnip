Turnip is an attempt at fully pure Lua VM writen in Haskell. It started as a compiler project (which got stuck around the AST phase) by a different person.

So far it can parse most of the Lua syntax into the AST.

My personal goal is providing a way to use Lua in Haskell without using `IO`. That's all.
